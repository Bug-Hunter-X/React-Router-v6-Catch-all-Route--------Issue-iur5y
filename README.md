This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route ('/*') in React Router v6.  The catch-all route, intended to handle 404 errors, can inadvertently prevent other routes from working correctly if not placed strategically in the Routes component.

The original App.js file showcases the problem.  The solution, in AppSolution.js, demonstrates the correct placement of the catch-all route to resolve this issue.

This issue is important because incorrectly placed catch-all routes can lead to unexpected behavior and broken navigation in React applications.
